    "* Randomized threshold + chance + single shot\n",
    "    * Maybe most realistic to keep some nodes uninfected while still adding stochasticity\n",
    "    * IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE to note:\n",
    "        * In ICM, each *infectious* node has one chance to infect\n",
    "        * Each uninfected node can still have multiple chances to *get* infected\n",
    "        * In this, each *uninfected* node would have one chance to get infected\n",
    "        * This, in addition to the threshold, might make the infection harder to spread\n",
    "    * Could randomize the chance within a range too\n",
